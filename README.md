# DetMax-Algorithm
An improved algorithm of strain feature selection
we develop and improve a computational method to select the number, 
position and angle direction of strain gauge by using the determinant 
maximization optimization design technology. This method takes the data 
set created by the finite element analysis as the input, combines the 
advantages of the random gradient method and the determinant maximization 
algorithm, obtains the local minimum through the iteration within the 
extremum neighborhood, and obtains the whole through the global random 
gradient search Local minimum, which takes into account the requirements 
of calculation accuracy and efficiency, provides the most accurate patch 
method for component load estimation.
